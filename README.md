# Load_Balancer-VM_Scale_Set

## Project Overview
This project provides hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure, focusing on building scalable and highly available infrastructure using Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) and Load Balancers. It also covers essential Azure services such as Virtual Networks (VNet), resource management, automation, and networking.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement Azure VM Scale Sets for automatic scaling of virtual machines.
- Configure and deploy Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic across VM instances.
- Set up and manage Virtual Networks for secure and efficient communication.
- Gain practical experience in Azure resource management and automation.
- Explore networking concepts and configurations in Azure.

## Components
- **Azure VMSS (Virtual Machine Scale Set):** Automatically scales the number of VM instances based on demand.
- **Azure Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple VM instances to ensure high availability.
- **Azure VNet (Virtual Network):** Provides isolated and secure network environments for Azure resources.

## Hands-On Goals
- Implement scalability using VMSS.
- Configure Load Balancer for traffic distribution.
- Set up VNet for secure communication between resources.
- Manage resources efficiently using Azure Resource Manager.
- Automate deployment and scaling using Azure automation tools.
- Explore and configure networking settings for optimal performance.

## Prerequisites
- An active Azure subscription.
- Basic understanding of cloud computing and Azure services.
- Familiarity with networking concepts.
- Azure CLI or PowerShell installed for command-line operations.
- Visual Studio Code or any preferred IDE for scripting.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create a Resource Group** to contain all related resources.
2. **Set up a Virtual Network (VNet)** and subnets for VMSS and Load Balancer.
3. **Deploy a VM Scale Set** with a custom or default image.
4. **Configure Load Balancer** to distribute traffic across VM instances.
5. **Set up health probes and load balancing rules** for traffic management.
6. **Enable autoscaling** based on CPU usage or other metrics.
7. **Automate deployment** using ARM templates or Azure CLI scripts.
8. **Test the setup** by generating traffic and monitoring performance.
9. **Monitor and manage resources** using Azure Portal or CLI.

## Conclusion
This project equips you with the skills to build scalable and highly available applications on Azure using VMSS and Load Balancer. It also enhances your understanding of Azure networking, automation, and resource management.
