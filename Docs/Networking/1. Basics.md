# Basics

## 1. What is Networking in Cloud?

* Networking in cloud = how resources (VMs, databases, applications) communicate with each other and the internet.

* In Azure, networking is managed mainly through Virtual Networks (VNet).

* Networking ensures:

    - **Connectivity** between resources (VMs, storage, databases).

    - **Security** via firewalls, NSGs, and encryption.

    - **Scalability** with load balancers and peering.

* Example in your project:

    -  A web server VM inside a VNet needs internet access →   use public IP + NSG rule.

    -  Database VM should only talk to web server, not       internet → private IP + restricted NSG.

##  2. OSI Model 

The OSI model describes **layers of communication** in a network. For your project, focus only on practical layers:

* **Layer 3 – Network**

    - Deals with IP addressing (public/private IP).

    - Azure VNets, subnets, and routing.

* **Layer 4 – Transport**

    - Deals with TCP/UDP ports (HTTP = TCP 80, HTTPS = TCP 443).

    - Azure Load Balancer works here.

* **Layer 7 – Application**

    - Deals with actual requests (URLs, headers, SSL/TLS).

    - Azure Application Gateway & Front Door work here.

*Note*
```
When deploying this project, you’ll configure IP addresses (L3), open specific ports (L4), and maybe use an App Gateway (L7).
```

## 3. Public vs Private IP

* **Public IP:**

    - Reachable over the internet.

    - Used for resources like Load Balancers, Web Apps, or   Bastion Host.

    - Example: Your project’s website exposed to internet → needs a public IP.

* **Private IP:**

    - Only accessible within Azure VNet or via VPN/ExpressRoute.

    - Used for databases or internal services.

    - Example: Azure SQL Database VM in project → should use private IP only for security.

## 4. Ports and Protocols

Different services use standard ports to communicate:

* HTTP (80/TCP):

    - Unencrypted web traffic.

    - Example: Your web server might allow HTTP but redirect to HTTPS.

* HTTPS (443/TCP):

    - Secure encrypted web traffic.

    - Must be enabled for public-facing websites in your project.

* RDP (3389/TCP):

    - Remote Desktop Protocol → used to connect to Windows VMs.

    - Should be restricted (only your IP should access).

* SSH (22/TCP):

    - Secure Shell → used to connect to Linux VMs.

    - Should also be restricted, not open to everyone.

 *Note*
```            
Allow only 80/443 to web servers.

Use 22/3389 only for admin access with restricted IPs or via Azure Bastion.
