# IP_and_Subnets
## 1. **IPv4 vs IPv6**

* **IPv4 (Internet Protocol v4)**

    - Uses 32-bit addressing → about 4.3 billion unique addresses.

    - Format: 192.168.1.1.

    - Still most widely used in Azure networking.

* **IPv6 (Internet Protocol v6)**

    - Uses 128-bit addressing → almost unlimited addresses.

    - Format: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

    - Azure supports IPv6 in VNets, load balancers, and public IPs.

*note*
```
Most Azure VNets and subnets you’ll configure will use IPv4. IPv6 may be needed if your application must support global scale or comply with modern standards.
```

## **2. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**

* Defines IP address ranges with flexibility.

* Format: <IP address>/<prefix length>.

* Example:

    - 10.0.0.0/24 → 256 IP addresses (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255).

    - 10.0.0.0/16 → 65,536 IP addresses.

*Note*
```
When creating an Azure VNet, you must specify an address space in CIDR notation.

- Example: 10.0.0.0/16 for the VNet.

- Inside it, you create subnets like:

    -   10.0.1.0/24 → for web servers.

    -   10.0.2.0/24 → for databases.
```

## **3. Subnetting Basics (Why Divide Networks?)**

 * **Subnetting** = dividing a network into smaller sections.

* Helps with:

    - **Security** → isolate front-end, back-end, and database tiers.

    - **Scalability** → assign IPs more efficiently.

    - **Traffic Management** → apply different NSGs/firewall rules per subnet.


## **4. Azure VNet (Virtual Network) IP Address Ranges**

* Azure VNets use private IP ranges (RFC 1918):

    - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255

    - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255

    - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

* Each VNet can have one or more address spaces (CIDR blocks).

* You define subnets within those ranges.

* Azure automatically reserves 5 IPs in each subnet (for gateway, DNS, etc.).
