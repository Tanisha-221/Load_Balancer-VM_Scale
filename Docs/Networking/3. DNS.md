# **Domain Name System (DNS)**

## **1. DNS = Phonebook of the Internet.**

* Converts human-readable names (like myproject.com) into IP addresses (like 52.167.21.3).

* Without DNS, users would have to type IPs to access websites.

* Works in a hierarchy:

    - Root → Top-Level Domain (.com, .org) → Domain (example.com) → Subdomain (app.example.com).

*Note*
```
If you deploy a website on Azure (say using App Service or VMs), instead of giving users a public IP, you’ll register a custom domain like myazureproject.com.
```

## **2. How DNS Resolves Names → IPs**

* Step-by-step name resolution:

* User enters www.myproject.com in the browser.

* Query goes to **Local DNS Resolver** (ISP, corporate DNS, or local cache).

* If not found → goes up the hierarchy:

    - Root Server → .com Server → myproject.com DNS Zone.

* DNS Server responds with the public IP (e.g., 52.167.21.3).

* Browser connects to the IP → Load Balancer → Web Server → Response back to user.

*Note*
```
When you create a public-facing Azure service, users will use DNS names (not IPs). Example:

    - Azure VM might have DNS name: myproject.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com.

    - You can map your custom domain to this Azure DNS name.
```
## **3. Azure DNS Service (Custom Domains)**

* Azure DNS lets you host your domain’s DNS records in Azure.

* Instead of using GoDaddy/Namecheap for DNS, you can manage everything in Azure.

* Supports record types:

    - **A Record:**   Maps domain → IPv4 address.

    - **AAAA Record:**   Maps domain → IPv6 address.

    - **CNAME Record:** Maps domain → another domain (e.g., www → root domain).

    - **TXT Record:** For verification/security (e.g., SPF, DKIM, Office 365).

*Note*
```
If your project’s app is hosted on Azure, you can:

- Register a custom domain like myazureproject.com.

- Use Azure DNS Zone to manage records.

- Create an A record → point domain to Azure Load Balancer’s public IP.

- Create a CNAME record → map subdomain www.myazureproject.com to your web app.
