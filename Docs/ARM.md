# üìò Scalable Azure Resource Management with Load Balancer

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and deploy a **scalable infrastructure on Microsoft Azure**, focusing on the configuration of a **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)** integrated with a **Load Balancer**. It provides practical experience in cloud resource management, automation, networking, and documentation best practices.

---

## üéØ Objective

To deploy and manage scalable Azure resources using:

- Azure Load Balancer (Public)
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets (Flexible Orchestration)
- Networking components (VNet, NIC, Subnet)
- Automation tools like Azure CLI / PowerShell
- Documentation management with GitHub
