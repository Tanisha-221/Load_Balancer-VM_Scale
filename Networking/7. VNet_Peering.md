# **VNet_Peering**
## **1. Connecting VNets Securely**

* **What is VNet Peering?**

    * VNet Peering connects two or more Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) so they can communicate securely and privately using the Azure backbone (no internet needed).

    * Once peered:

        * Resources in VNet A can talk to resources in VNet B using private IPs.

        * Very low latency, high bandwidth (similar to being in the same network).

    * Traffic between peered VNets is encrypted and does not traverse the public internet.


```
Project

You might have multiple VNets in your project:

* One for Web/App resources.

* One for Database resources.

* Peering ensures they can talk securely without exposing DB to the public internet.

```

## **2. Same Region vs Global Peering**

* *Same Region Peering:**

    * Connects VNets within the same Azure region.

    * Example: East US VNet1 ↔ East US VNet2.

    * Low cost and very common in projects.

    * Project Example: Web VNet and DB VNet in the same region (e.g., Central India).

* **Global VNet Peering:**

    * Connects VNets across different Azure regions.

    * Example: East US VNet ↔ West Europe VNet.

    * Useful for global apps or DR (Disaster Recovery).



## **3. Hub-Spoke Architecture in Azure**

* **What is it?**

    * A network topology where:

        * The Hub VNet is the central point → contains shared services (e.g., Azure Firewall, VPN Gateway, Bastion).

        * Spoke VNets are connected to the hub via VNet peering → each spoke hosts workloads (Web, App, DB).

    * Spokes do not directly connect with each other — they communicate via the hub.

* Benefits:

    * Centralized security (Azure Firewall, NSGs, monitoring all in Hub).

    * Easier to manage (add/remove spokes without breaking others).

    * Enterprise-ready, highly scalable.
