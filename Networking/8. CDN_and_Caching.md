# CDN_and_Caching
## **1. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Basics**

* What is a CDN?

    * A Content Delivery Network is a globally distributed network of servers that deliver web content (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos) to users from the server closest to them.

    * Improves website performance by reducing latency and offloading traffic from your origin server.

    * Especially important for websites with global users.
```
Example 

If your project’s website is hosted in Central India, a user in Europe would normally face latency. With CDN, cached content is served from a nearby Europe edge node → much faster response.

```

## **2. Azure CDN**

* **What is it?**

    * Azure CDN is Microsoft’s fully managed CDN service that integrates with your web apps, storage, and APIs.

    * It caches static content (like images, CSS, JS, videos) at Microsoft’s edge locations worldwide.

    * Built-in integration with Azure Storage, Web Apps, and Azure Front Door.

* **Key Features:**

    * Global edge locations for faster delivery.

    * HTTPS support and custom domains.

    * Dynamic site acceleration (DSA) for APIs and dynamic content.

    * Analytics → see hit/miss ratios, traffic patterns.

```
Example

* If your project deploys a scalable website:

    * Store static content (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) in Azure Blob Storage.

    * Enable Azure CDN → users worldwide get faster load times.

    * Combine with Load Balancer/Application Gateway for dynamic content.

```

## **3. How Caching Reduces Latency**

* Caching = temporary storage of data closer to the user.

* Two main caching scenarios:

    * Edge Caching (CDN):

        * Frequently requested files are stored at CDN edge servers.

        * Reduces travel distance → content delivered in milliseconds.

        * Project Example: Website logo/images served from Azure CDN instead of origin web server.

* Application/Database Caching:

    * Store frequently accessed queries/results in Redis Cache (Azure Cache for Redis).

    * Reduces load on DB, improves application responsiveness.

    * Project Example: If your site has a “Top 10 Products” page, store results in cache to avoid hitting DB repeatedly.
